	abstract = {Background: Two related merozoite surface proteins, MSP3 and MSP6, have previously been identified as targets of antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI), a protective mechanism against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both MSP3 and MSP6 share a common characteristic small N-terminal signature amino-acid stretch (NLRNA/G), a feature similar to MSP3-like orthologs identified in other human and primate malaria parasites.
Methods/Results: This signature amino-acid sequence led to the identification of eight ORFs contiguously located on P. falciparum chromosome 10. Our subsequent investigations on their expression, localization, sequence conservation, epitope sharing, immunogenicity and the functional role of antibodies in defense are reported here. Six members of P. falciparum MSP3-multigene family share similar sequence organization within their C-terminal regions, are simultaneously expressed as merozoite surface proteins and are highly conserved among parasite isolates. Each of these proteins is a target of naturally occurring antibodies effective at parasite killing in ADCI assays. Moreover, both naturally occurring antibodies and those generated by immunization display cross-reactivity with other members of the family and exhibit varied binding avidities.
Conclusions/Significance: The unusual characteristics of the MSP3 multi-gene family lead us to hypothesize that the simultaneous expression of targets eliciting cross-reactive antibody responses capable of controlling parasite densities could represent an immune process selected through evolution to maintain homeostasis between P. falciparum and human hosts; a process that allows the continuous transmission of the parasite without killing the host. Our observations also have practical consequences for vaccine development by suggesting MSP3 vaccine efficacy might be improved when combined with the various C-terminus regions of the MSP3 family members to generate a wider range of antibodies acting and to increase vaccine immunogenicity in varied human genetic backgrounds.},

abstract = {A cDNA clone encoding part of a novel polymorphic merozoite antigen from Plasmodium falciparum was isolated by screening a cDNA library with human immune serum from Papua New guinea. Immunofluoresence microscopy and immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies recognized a highly polymorphic antigen, Ag956, present in schizonts and merozoites. Biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Ag956 is proteolytically cleaved during merozoite maturation. The complete genomic sequence of Ag956 from the D10 clone of P. falciparum isolate FC27 encodes a secreted protein of calculated molecular mass 43 243 that is very hydrophilic and contains a region of unusual heptad repeats of the general structure AXXAXXX. This antigen has been named the secreted polymorphic antigen associated with merozoites (SPAM). The sequence of a second SPAM allele from the 3D7 clone of isolate NF54 reveals that the alanine heptad repeats and the hydrophilic C-terminal half of the protein are conserved. Variation among SPAM alleles is the result of deletion and amino acid substitutions in non-repetitive sequences within and flanking the alanine heptad-repeat domain. Heptad repeats in which the a and d position contain hydrophobic residues generate amphipathic α-helices which give rise to helical bundles or coiled-coil structures in proteins. Thus, SPAM is the first example of a P. falciparum antigen in which a repetitive sequence has features characteristics of a well-defined structural element.}

One of these proteins, merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) represents a leading component among vaccine candidates; however, little is known about its structure and function. Our biophysical studies suggest that the 40 residue C-terminal domain of MSP3 protein self-assembles into a four-stranded α–helical coiled coil structure where α–helices are packed “side-by-side”. A bioinformatics analysis provides an extended list of known and putative proteins from different species of Plasmodium which have such MSP3-like C-terminal domains. This finding allowed us to extend some conclusions of our studies to a larger group of the malaria surface proteins. Possible structural and functional roles of these highly conserved oligomerization domains in the intact merozoite surface proteins are discussed.},

	abstract = {Malaria erythrocyte binding proteins use the Duffy blood group antigen (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi) and sialic acid (Plasmodium falciparum) on the erythrocyte surface as receptors. We had previously cloned the one P. vivax gene, the one P. falciparum gene, and part of one of the three P. knowlesi genes encoding these erythrocyte binding proteins and described the homology between the P. knowlesi and P. vivax genes. We have completed the cloning and sequencing of the three P. knowlesi genes and identified introns in the P. vivax and P. falciparum genes that correct the previously published deduced amino acid sequences. All have similar structures, with one or two exons encoding the signal sequence and the erythrocyte binding domain, an exon encoding the transmembrane domain, and two exons encoding the cytoplasmic domain with the exception of the P. knowlesi beta gene. The regions of amino acid sequence homology among all the genes are the 5{\textquoteright} and 3{\textquoteright} cysteine-rich regions of the erythrocyte binding domain. On the basis of gene structure and amino acid homology, we propose that the Duffy binding proteins and the sialic acid binding protein are members of a gene family. The level of conservation (approximately 70\%) of the deduced amino acid sequences in the 5{\textquoteright} cysteine-rich region between the P. vivax protein and the three P. knowlesi proteins is as great as between the three P. knowlesi proteins themselves; the P. knowlesi beta protein just 3{\textquoteright} to this cysteine-rich region is homologous to the P. vivax protein but not to the other P. knowlesi proteins. Conservation of amino acid sequences among these organisms, separated in evolution, may indicate the regions where the adhesin function resides.},

Both EBA-175 and BAEBL localize to the micronemes, organelles at the invasive ends of the parasites that contain other members of the family. Like EBA-175, the erythrocyte receptor for BAEBL is destroyed by neuraminidase and trypsin, indicating that the erythrocyte receptor is a sialoglycoprotein. Its specificity, however, differs from that of EBA-175 in that BAEBL can bind to erythrocytes that lack glycophorin A, the receptor for EBA-175. It has reduced binding to erythrocytes with the Gerbich mutation found in another erythrocyte, sialoglycoprotein (glycophorin C/D). The interest in BAEBL{\textquoteright}s reduced binding to Gerbich erythrocytes derives from the high frequency of the Gerbich phenotype in some regions of Papua New Guinea where P. falciparum is hyperendemic.},

	abstract = {Proteins on the surface of the merozoite, the invasive form of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and those secreted from its apical secretory organelles are promising vaccine candidates against blood stage malaria. In the present study, we have identified a novel parasite protein (PfDBLMSP; Gene ID PF10\_0348), that harbors a predicted signal sequence, a central Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain and a secreted polymorphic antigen associated with merozoites (SPAM) domain in its C-terminal half. Transcription and translation of pfdblmsp is up-regulated specifically in schizont stage parasites, similar to other well-chararacterized merozoite proteins involved in invasion of red blood cells (RBCs). PfDBLMSP was localized on the merozoite surface with a GFP targeting approach using schizont-stage specific expression systems, and by immunofluorescence assays of the endogenous protein. PfDBLMSP expressed on the surface of mammalian cells (COS-7) showed binding with human RBCs and this binding was sensitive to trypsin and neuraminidase treatments. The recombinant proteins corresponding to the DBL and SPAM domains showed reactivity with immune sera from individuals residing in P. falciparum endemic areas. Polymorphism in PfDBLMSP sequences from different P. falciparum strains and field isolates suggested that its DBL domain is under natural immune pressure. Our data on localization and functional assays suggest a possible role of PfDBLMSP in binding of merozoites with erythrocytes during invasion.},
