From Vivian Monzon, 24/08/2021:


> Maybe you have already tried this, but I would first search for homologous sequences, e.g. using jackhmmer (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/search/jackhmmer), to find out if the domain is distantly related to known adhesive domains. Then I would suggest to predict the structure with AlphaFold or other advanced structure prediction methods. The structure model can help you to investigate the domain by eye and secondly to search in the PDB database for similar structures, e.g. using DALI (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/). 
> If you have found a similar structure or sequence domain you hopefully know more about the function of this domain and maybe even a potential binding ligand it interacts with. 
> 
> There exists docking tools (I am just getting familiar with them), but as far as I know for applying them it would be easier if you know the binding ligand or a selection of possible candidates already.
